                          ORION has a data protection regime in place to oversee
                          the affective and secure processing of Personal Data.
                          ORION takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal
                          Data provided via the web applications from loss,
                          misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure,
                          alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or
                          e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error
                          free. Therefore, you should take special care in
                          deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.
                          With respect to your payment information, please note
                          that ORION works to protect the security of all your
                          information during transmission over the Internet by
                          using Transport Security Layer(TLS) to encrypt your
                          credit card number and personal data. ORION will use
                          your credit card information only to process your
                          payment and will not retain or otherwise store your
                          credit card information after the processing of your
                          payment.

                          We take appropriate steps to ensure that Personal Data
                          is processed, secured, and transferred according to
                          applicable law. The areas in which any recipients are
                          located will vary from time to time, but may include
                          the United States, Europe, Canada, Asia, Australia,
                          India and other countries where ORION has a presence

                          laws do not offer the same level of data privacy
                          protection as in your home country, we take measures
                          to provide an appropriate level of data privacy
